Live on [https://dipsywong98.github.io/SpyFall/](https://dipsywong98.github.io/SpyFall/)

This is just copying from the game by [Hobby World](http://international.hobbyworld.ru/) and other related repos
(https://github.com/scooter3/spyfall/, https://github.com/adrianocola/spyfall), and made with ~~nextjs (removed since it is not helpful for this kind of appllication)~~ react framework with redux using firebase as storage. (In short I am just practising my programming skill and learn new stuff when I am procrastinating my Robotics project) I hope my code would look better but in fact it is horrible. Currently this only have Chinese and English version, maybe later I would ~~futhur copy from other's repo, thanks MIT License~~
